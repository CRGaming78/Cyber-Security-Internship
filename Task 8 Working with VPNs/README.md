# Task 8: Using a VPN for Privacy and Security

## 1. Objective

The goal of this task was to understand the role of a VPN in protecting online privacy and securing communications. The process involved setting up a free VPN client, testing its functionality by verifying an IP address change, and researching its benefits and limitations.

## 2. Tool Used

-   **VPN Client:** Windscribe
-   **Verification Website:** `https://www.whatismyipaddress.com`

## 3. VPN Setup and Testing Process

### Step 1: Initial IP Address Check
Before activating the VPN, I checked my public IP address to establish a baseline.

### Step 2: VPN Connection
I installed and launched the Windscribe VPN client and connected to a free server located in the Netherlands. The client provided a clear "Connected" status.

### Step 3: Verifying the New IP Address
After a successful connection, I revisited the IP address checker website. The site now displayed a new IP address and location, confirming that my traffic was being successfully routed through the VPN server.

## 4. Summary on VPN Benefits and Limitations

A VPN is a powerful tool for enhancing personal online security and privacy.

**Benefits:**
-   **Privacy from ISP:** It prevents your Internet Service Provider (ISP) from monitoring your online activity, as all traffic is encrypted.
-   **Security on Public Wi-Fi:** It protects your data from being intercepted by malicious actors when you are using unsecured public Wi-Fi networks.
-   **Bypass Geo-restrictions:** It allows you to access content and services that might be blocked in your geographical region by making it appear as if you are browsing from a different location.
-   **Anonymity from Websites:** It masks your real IP address, making it harder for websites and advertisers to track you.

**Limitations:**
-   **Speed Reduction:** The encryption process and the extra distance data must travel inevitably slow down the internet connection speed.
-   **Trust in the Provider:** A VPN is only as secure as its provider. You are transferring your trust from your ISP to the VPN company, so choosing a reputable provider with a strict "no-logs" policy is essential.
-   **Not Complete Anonymity:** A VPN does not make you 100% anonymous. You can still be tracked through browser cookies, fingerprinting, or by logging into personal accounts.
-   **VPN Blocking:** Many streaming services and some websites actively detect and block connections from known VPN servers.
