# Task 3: Basic Vulnerability Scan on My PCs
---

## Objective
Use free tools to identify common vulnerabilities on my computers.

## Tools Used
*   **Scanner:** Nessus Essentials
*   **Operating Systems Scanned:**
    *   Windows 11 (Host PC - Presumed, as you mentioned "my pc") - IP: `192.168.1.12`
    *   Windows 7 (Virtual Machine) - IP: `192.168.1.4`

## Installation and Setup
*   Registered for Nessus Essentials and obtained an activation code.
*   Downloaded and installed Nessus Essentials.
*   Accessed Nessus via `https://127.0.0.1:8834/` (or `https://localhost:8834/`).
*   Created an admin account and activated with the provided code.
*   Allowed Nessus plugins to download and update.

## Scan Configuration
Two separate scans were configured and run:

### Scan 1: Windows 7 VM
*   **Scan Name:** `win7 / 192.168.1.12` *(Note: The screenshot shows this name, but the IP in "Host Details" is 192.168.1.12. Assuming the name was intended for Win7 and IP 192.168.1.4 was the target, or vice-versa. Clarify if needed.)*
*   **Scan Template Used:** Basic Network Scan (Presumed)
*   **Target:** `192.168.1.12` (as per "Host Details" in the first screenshot)
*   **Scan Type:** Unauthenticated vulnerability scan

### Scan 2: My Basic Network Scan (Windows 11 Host PC)
*   **Scan Name:** `My Basic Network Scan / 192.168.1.4` *(Note: The screenshot shows this name, but the IP in "Host Details" is 192.168.1.4. This IP might be the Win7 VM, and the other IP (1.12) your Win11 host. Please adjust descriptions if my interpretation of which IP belongs to which OS is incorrect based on your setup.)*
*   **Scan Template Used:** Basic Network Scan (Presumed)
*   **Target:** `192.168.1.4` (as per "Host Details" in the second screenshot)
*   **Scan Type:** Unauthenticated vulnerability scan

## Scan Results Summary

Both scans completed in approximately 13 minutes and primarily identified **Informational** findings. No Critical, High, or Medium severity vulnerabilities were detected in these unauthenticated scans.

### Results for `192.168.1.12` (Presumed Windows 7 VM or Windows 11 PC):
*   **Critical Vulnerabilities:** 0
*   **High Vulnerabilities:** 0
*   **Medium Vulnerabilities:** 0
*   **Low Vulnerabilities:** 0
*   **Informational Findings:** 4
    *   Ethernet Card Manufacturer Detection (Misc.)
    *   Ethernet MAC Address (General)
    *   Nessus Scan Information (Settings)
    *   Traceroute Information (General)

### Results for `192.168.1.4` (Presumed Windows 11 PC or Windows 7 VM):
*   **Critical Vulnerabilities:** 0
*   **High Vulnerabilities:** 0
*   **Medium Vulnerabilities:** 0
*   **Low Vulnerabilities:** 0
*   **Informational Findings:** 4
    *   Ethernet Card Manufacturer Detection (Misc.)
    *   Ethernet MAC Address (General)
    *   Nessus Scan Information (Settings)
    *   Traceroute Information (General)

## Detailed Informational Findings

Since no vulnerabilities of Medium severity or higher were found, the primary findings are informational, helping to fingerprint the devices:

1.  **Nessus Scan Information:**
    *   **Severity:** Info
    *   **Description:** Provides details about the Nessus scan itself, such as the scanner version, plugin set, and port scanner used. This is standard for all Nessus scans.
    *   **Remediation:** None required; informational.

2.  **Ethernet MAC Address:**
    *   **Severity:** Info
    *   **Description:** Reports the MAC address of the network interface on the scanned host. This is a basic network discovery finding.
    *   **Remediation:** None required; informational.

3.  **Ethernet Card Manufacturer Detection:**
    *   **Severity:** Info
    *   **Description:** Attempts to identify the manufacturer of the Ethernet card based on its MAC address (OUI - Organizationally Unique Identifier).
    *   **Remediation:** None required; informational.

4.  **Traceroute Information:**
    *   **Severity:** Info
    *   **Description:** Shows the network hops taken to reach the target host from the Nessus scanner. For a local scan (`localhost` or local IP), this will likely be very short (0 or 1 hop).
    *   **Remediation:** None required; informational.

## Security Observations and Discussion
The absence of Critical, High, or Medium vulnerabilities in an unauthenticated scan suggests that, from an external network perspective without credentials, the machines do not immediately present easily exploitable, known high-risk vulnerabilities that Nessus checks for in a basic scan.

*   **Windows 7 Considerations:** While this scan didn't pick up specific vulnerabilities, Windows 7 is an end-of-life operating system and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft (without a paid Extended Security Update plan, which is rare for home users). It is inherently risky to use and likely has many unpatched vulnerabilities that a more in-depth or authenticated scan might reveal, or that could be targeted by specific exploits not covered in a generic plugin set.
*   **Windows 11 Considerations:** A modern, patched Windows 11 system is expected to have a good baseline security posture against common remote vulnerabilities.
*   **Unauthenticated Scan Limitations:** This type of scan primarily looks for vulnerabilities in network services listening on open ports and for some OS fingerprinting. It cannot see missing patches for local software, weak local user passwords, or misconfigurations that require authenticated access to detect. An **authenticated scan** (where Nessus is provided with credentials to log into the machines) would provide a much more comprehensive view of the internal security posture, including patch levels and local software vulnerabilities.
